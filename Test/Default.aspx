            <h2>Why use a reporting tool?</h2>
            <p>
                In a time with ever increasing data, where it is difficult to clearly transform this data into meaningful information, 
                companies rely on visual representations in order to clarify the message they want to tell.
                In order to ensure that this data storytelling happens in an efficient way, 
                organizations are in need of a suitable reporting tool.
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories.</p>

            <h2>The need for a supporting guideline... </h2>
            <p>
                Companies have, however, difficulties to choose an appropriate reporting solution that suits their business requirements. 
                There already exist several independent information technology research and advisory firms, whose main goal is to score products and position them in the market. 
                These reports, however, contain a lot of information which causes difficulties in establishing a clear picture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Reporting Tool Selection model attempts to provide the ideal marriage 
                between the business needs of an organization and the objective scores of the tools, 
                based on a number of predefined criteria.
