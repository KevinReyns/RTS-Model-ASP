                In a time with ever increasing data, where it is difficult to clearly transfer information from that data, 
                this information will be illustrated through visual representations. 
                In order to ensure that this storytelling happens in an efficient way, 
                organizations need to have a suitable reporting tool.

            <h2>A guideline to support...</h2>
            <p>
                Companies have, however, difficulties to choose an appropriate reporting solution that matches their business needs. 
                There are already several consultancies scoring tools and positioning them in the market. 
                However, these reports contain a lot of information which causes difficulties to establish a clear picture. 
                Furthermore, these reports are often written in their generality, 
                which causes businesses to have to look for the suitable tool that fits their organization themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Reporting Tool Selection model attempts to provide the ideal marriage 
                between the business needs of an organization and the objective scores of tools, 
                based on a number of predefined criteria.
